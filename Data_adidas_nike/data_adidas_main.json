You'll find all the timeless details, like a ribbed crewneck and a small Trefoil logo on the front. Everyone's favorite kitty shows up twice with bright blooms from her garden — once near the hem and again on the back. That's summery fun that you can add to any outfit any time.\n\nWe partner with Better Cotton to improve cotton farming globally. Better Cotton makes global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in, and better for the sector's future. \n\nBetter Cotton is sourced via a chain of custody model called mass balance. This means that Better Cotton is not physically traceable to end products, however, Better Cotton Farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we \"source.\" \n\nFind out more here: bettercotton.org/learnmore\nDetails\nRegular fit\nRibbed crewneck\n100% cotton single jersey\n©2022 SANRIO CO., TLD.\nMade with Better Cotton\nImported\nProduct color: White\nProduct code: IM2256",

Better Cotton makes global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in, and better for the sector's future.  \n\nBetter Cotton is sourced via a chain-of-custody model called mass balance. This means that Better Cotton is not physically traceable to end products. However, Better Cotton Farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we \"source.\" \n\nFind out more here: bettercotton.org/learn more\n\nOne universal fact about kids: They are always growing and changing — and their bodies are, too. That's why we now offer kids' extended sizing for our most popular apparel. Because kids deserve great-fitting, functional gear they can feel confident wearing.\n\nFor years, our industry has used phrases like \"plus size\" and \"husky size\" to label some kids' changing bodies. Our extended sizing isn't about labeling, it's about updating our size range to make it easier for children (and their parents) to find that just-right size.\nDetails\nRegular Fit\n60% cotton, 40% polyester jersey\nRibbed crewneck and cuffs\nMachine washable\nImported\nProduct color: Dark Heather\nProduct code: IR3367",

This boys' adidas long sleeve hooded tee is made from soft cotton and polyester jersey fabric that keeps kids covered but isn't bulky or too warm. The tee is easy to layer, and the hood is there when needed.\n\nWe partner with Better Cotton to improve cotton farming globally. Better Cotton makes global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in, and better for the sector's future.  \n\nBetter Cotton is sourced via a chain-of-custody model called mass balance. This means that Better Cotton is not physically traceable to end products. However, Better Cotton Farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we \"source.\" \n\nFind out more here: bettercotton.org/learn more\n\nOne universal fact about kids: They are always growing and changing — and their bodies are, too. That's why we now offer kids' extended sizing for our most popular apparel. Because kids deserve great-fitting, functional gear they can feel confident wearing.\n\nFor years, our industry has used phrases like \"plus size\" and \"husky size\" to label some kids' changing bodies. Our extended sizing isn't about labeling, it's about updating our size range to make it easier for children (and their parents) to find that just-right size.\nDetails\nRegular Fit\n60% cotton, 40% polyester jersey\nPullover with hood\nRibbed cuffs\nMachine washable\nImported\nProduct color: Olive Heathered\nProduct code: IR3360",

It's made of soft cotton-blend fleece and has a classic kangaroo pocket. An adidas Badge of Sport on the chest adds authentic sporty style.\n\nWe partner with Better Cotton to improve cotton farming globally. Better Cotton makes global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in, and better for the sector's future.  \n\nBetter Cotton is sourced via a chain-of-custody model called mass balance. This means that Better Cotton is not physically traceable to end products. However, Better Cotton Farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we \"source.\" \n\nFind out more here: bettercotton.org/learn more\n\nOne universal fact about kids: They are always growing and changing — and their bodies are, too. That's why we now offer kids' extended sizing for our most popular apparel. Because kids deserve great-fitting, functional gear they can feel confident wearing.\n\nFor years, our industry has used phrases like \"plus size\" and \"husky size\" to label some kids' changing bodies. Our extended sizing isn't about labeling, it's about updating our size range to make it easier for children (and their parents) to find that just-right size.\nDetails\nRegular Fit\n58% cotton, 42% polyester fleece\nKangaroo pocket keeps hands warm\nRibbed cuffs and hem\nMachine washable\nImported\nProduct color: Olive\nProduct code: IR3359",

Better Cotton makes global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in, and better for the sector's future.  \n\nBetter Cotton is sourced via a chain-of-custody model called mass balance. This means that Better Cotton is not physically traceable to end products. However, Better Cotton Farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we \"source.\" \n\nFind out more here: bettercotton.org/learn more\n\nOne universal fact about kids: They are always growing and changing — and their bodies are, too. That's why we now offer kids' extended sizing for our most popular apparel. Because kids deserve great-fitting, functional gear they can feel confident wearing.\n\nFor years, our industry has used phrases like \"plus size\" and \"husky size\" to label some kids' changing bodies. Our extended sizing isn't about labeling, it's about updating our size range to make it easier for children (and their parents) to find that just-right size.\nDetails\nRelaxed Fit\n100% cotton jersey\nRibbed crewneck holds its shape\nWaist length\nMachine washable\nImported\nProduct color: Black\nProduct code: IR3357",

This adidas mock-neck pullover for girls is made from furry Lurex fleece fabric that's super-soft and cozy with a shiny look. There's a zipper at the neck for quick adjustments and a convenient kangaroo pocket.\n\nOne universal fact about kids: They are always growing and changing — and their bodies are, too. That's why we now offer kids' extended sizing for our most popular apparel. Because kids deserve great-fitting, functional gear they can feel confident wearing.\n\nFor years, our industry has used phrases like \"plus size\" and \"husky size\" to label some kids' changing bodies. Our extended sizing isn't about labeling, it's about updating our size range to make it easier for children (and their parents) to find that just-right size.\nDetails\nRelaxed Fit\n100% polyester furry lurex fleece\nThree-quarter zip with stand-up collar\nAngled welt pockets\nElastic cuffs and hem\nMachine washable\nImported\nProduct color: Black\nProduct code: IR3368",

    "description": "Description\nA BOMBER JACKET THAT'S READY TO MOVE.\nClassic vibes meet modern comfort. This juniors' bomber jacket has the signature sheen and contrast 3-Stripes that's synonymous with adidas track style. The main difference is that it features AEROREADY. That way, you stay dry and comfortable if you wear it as an extra layer at practice.\n\nOne universal fact about kids: They are always growing and changing — and their bodies are, too. That's why we now offer kids' extended sizing for our most popular apparel. Because kids deserve great-fitting, functional gear they can feel confident wearing.\n\nFor years, our industry has used phrases like \"plus size\" to label some girls' changing bodies. Our extended sizing isn't about labeling, it's about updating our size range to make it easier for children (and their parents) to find that just-right size.\nDetails\nRegular fit\nFull zip with ribbed stand-up collar\n100% polyester tricot\nMoisture absorbing\nFront pockets\nRibbed cuffs and hem\nImported\nProduct color: Black\nProduct code: EY1999",

Better Cotton makes global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in, and better for the sector's future.  \n\nBetter Cotton is sourced via a chain-of-custody model called mass balance. This means that Better Cotton is not physically traceable to end products. However, Better Cotton Farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we \"source.\" \n\nFind out more here: bettercotton.org/learn more\n\nOne universal fact about kids: They are always growing and changing — and their bodies are, too. That's why we now offer kids' extended sizing for our most popular apparel. Because kids deserve great-fitting, functional gear they can feel confident wearing.\n\nFor years, our industry has used phrases like \"plus size\" and \"husky size\" to label some kids' changing bodies. Our extended sizing isn't about labeling, it's about updating our size range to make it easier for children (and their parents) to find that just-right size.\nDetails\nRelaxed Fit\n100% cotton jersey\nRibbed crewneck and cuffs\nWaist length\nMachine washable\nImported\nProduct color: Light Orchid\nProduct code: IR3365",

Our extended sizing isn't about labeling, it's about updating our size range to make it easier for children (and their parents) to find that just-right size.\nDetails\nRegular fit\nCrewneck\n100% recycled polyester mélange jersey\nMoisture absorbing\nScreenprinted adidas Badge of Sport\nPrimegreen\nImported\nProduct color: Scarlet\nProduct code: EY1958",

    "description": "Description\nOne tee that looks like two! This adidas long sleeve layered tee is made from soft, lightweight cotton jersey fabric and features a number of standard details like a ribbed neckband and screen printed graphics. Long sleeves are layered into the design, giving kids a little extra feel-good coverage.\n\nWe partner with Better Cotton to improve cotton farming globally. Better Cotton makes global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in, and better for the sector's future.  \n\nBetter Cotton is sourced via a chain-of-custody model called mass balance. This means that Better Cotton is not physically traceable to end products. However, Better Cotton Farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we \"source.\" \n\nFind out more here: bettercotton.org/learn more\nDetails\nRelaxed Fit\n100% cotton jersey\nRibbed crewneck and cuffs\nMachine washable\nImported\nProduct color: Olive\nProduct code: IR2848",
